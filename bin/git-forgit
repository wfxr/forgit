# This file is a bridge between forgit and git itself. This makes forgit a
# subcommand of git, and forwards all arguments on to forgit. So, all of these
# commands will work as expected:
#
# `git forgit log`
# `git forgit checkout_file`
# `git forgit checkout_file README.md`
#
# This gives users the choice to set aliases inside of their git config instead
# of their shell config if they prefer.
